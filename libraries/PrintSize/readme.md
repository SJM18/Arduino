# PrintSize

PrintSize is a minimal library to determine the length of a variable when printed.
This includes printing of floats

## Examples
Example show the alignment of 10 random numbers, 
both print(), println() and if supported printf().


### notes
Can be used to calculate the needed space.
 - to properly do a right alignment e.g. for numbers. 
 - do left alignement and overwrite previous output with spaces.
 - centering of numbers
 - see if output will fit into a line.
